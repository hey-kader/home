4xl tee shirts? stop making those, its fucked up.
slowly pull the rug, 4xl, 3xl, xxl, 
the idea of small, medium, large clothing is slowly fixing itself, with 
xxs, xs, s, m, l, xl, ... (an emergant spectrum of sizes)
maybe it would make people feel more unique if we treated them as 1/1s
lets just take your measurements, and maybe even you could let us know how you want your garmets to fit, length wise
maybe if a girl wants to show some skin, that metric of consumer data could be percieved by the market, and the market could creep on her for that. Then she would be scared, and feel less desire towards wanting to show some skin. 
im not trying to be a dick here these are just inscentive models
